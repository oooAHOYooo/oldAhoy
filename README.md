## The Ultimate Master Plan
We use a variety of out of house software and some in house - some out of the house - but rest assured - it's all custom configured. Little by little - click by click - we hope to make this platform completely code indepedent - and not rely on things like google - or facebook - or anything of the like - eff all that.

# The Ultimate Master Plan (draft 2)
---
## Introduction
The Ultimate Master Plan outlines a strategic vision to transform our platform into a fully code-independent solution. By leveraging a combination of in-house and customized external software, we aim to create a robust and self-reliant platform that eliminates dependencies on third-party services like Google or Facebook. Our plan is for a gradual and meticulous approach to achieving code independence.

## Current Software Landscape
Our scrappy little beauty of a platform currently utilizes a mix of in-house and external software. All software components are meticulously configured to align with our specific needs and requirements. But to be honest - the code is sloppy - if anyone is out there who can help - who likes to clean up code and makes things efficent - we could use some pro bono help. 

## Rationale for Code Independence

### Establishing Greater Control

By pursuing code independence, we aim to gain greater control over our platform's functionalities, features, and overall direction. Currently, relying on external software providers means that we are subject to their decisions and limitations. In some cases, these providers may introduce changes or updates that impact the functionality or user experience of our platform. By reducing our reliance on external software, we can take charge of the development and evolution of our platform, ensuring that it aligns with our vision and strategic goals.

### Enhancing Flexibility and Customization

Code independence allows us to tailor our platform to meet our specific business needs and adapt quickly to changing requirements. External software providers often offer a one-size-fits-all solution, which may not fully align with our unique business processes or customer demands. By developing custom solutions or sourcing alternatives, we can create a platform that is optimized for our specific use cases. This increased flexibility enables us to respond swiftly to market trends, user feedback, and emerging technologies, staying ahead of the competition and meeting customer expectations.

### Mitigating Risks

Relying heavily on external software introduces inherent risks that can impact the stability and continuity of our platform. Potential service disruptions, such as downtime or outages from third-party providers, can have severe consequences for our operations and customer satisfaction. Additionally, changes in terms of use or pricing models imposed by these providers can significantly impact our costs or limit our access to critical features. By reducing our dependence on external software, we mitigate these risks and gain more control over the reliability and availability of our platform. We can ensure seamless service delivery to our customers, reducing the potential for disruptions that could harm our reputation or business performance.

### Shaping the Platform's Future

Code independence empowers us to shape the future of our platform according to our vision and customer needs. Rather than being constrained by the roadmap and decisions of external providers, we have the freedom to prioritize features, enhancements, and integrations based on our strategic goals and user feedback. This agility allows us to stay ahead of industry trends, adapt to evolving customer expectations, and deliver innovative solutions that drive user engagement and satisfaction.

### Long-Term Sustainability

Building a code-independent platform establishes a foundation for long-term sustainability. By reducing reliance on external software providers, we decrease the risk of being locked into proprietary technologies or vendor-specific ecosystems. This independence enables us to evolve and adapt our platform as technology landscapes change, ensuring its relevance and viability in the long run. It also positions us to explore new partnerships, integrations, and revenue streams without being limited by the constraints of external providers.

In summary, pursuing code independence offers us greater control, flexibility, and long-term sustainability for our platform. It mitigates risks associated with external software providers, allowing us to shape the platform's future according to our vision and customer needs. By reducing dependencies and leveraging custom solutions, we can optimize our platform's functionality, enhance user experience, and stay at the forefront of our industry.

## About this Github Repo

This is the home for the code of Ahoy Indie Media
This code was hand-written by Alex Gonzalez circa 2023
This code is consists of a HTML document with embedded JavaScript and Vue.js code. 


## For the sake of being transparent - and for the non coding enthusist who hopes to dive a bit deeper into how a couple of scrappy folks can do something like this - here are some explainations of the code found on index.html 

HTML structure: The code begins with an opening <html> tag and includes various nested elements like <head>, <meta>, <link>, <title>, and <script>. These elements define the structure and content of the HTML document.

Vue.js: Vue.js is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. In this code, it is used to create two instances of Vue: app and app1. These instances define data, methods, and computed properties used in the application.

JavaScript functions: There are two JavaScript functions defined in the <script> tags. The first function toggleTransform() is used to toggle a CSS class on an element with the class .frontContent and marketData-section when called. The second function contains conditional logic to change the background image of the document based on the current time (hr variable).

Vue.js directives: The Vue.js directives v-show and @click are used on elements to control their visibility and bind click event handlers, respectively. The v-for directive is used to iterate over arrays and render dynamic content based on the data.

External resources: The code includes references to external resources such as Vue.js and Memberstack JavaScript libraries, CSS stylesheets (mainStyle.css and mobile.css), and other JavaScript files (marketData3.js and updates.js). These resources are loaded to provide additional functionality and styling to the webpage.

Comments: The code includes comments (enclosed within <!-- and -->) that provide additional information or indicate sections that are temporarily disabled.

Overall, this code combines HTML, JavaScript, and Vue.js to create a dynamic webpage with tabs for different content sections, background image changes based on the time, and integration with external resources and libraries.
