## Ahoy Indie Media is a hand-crafted media company based out of New Haven, Connecticut. 
Our mission is to provide an alternative option in media.

### How we plan on making money
Ahoy Marketplace offers exclusive in-house content, including "The Rob Show," available on-demand with a monthly subscription. We hope to keep this platform completely ad free - and that's going to take some money - thus - you can show your support for indie creators and enjoy uninterrupted access while also contributing to the platform's upkeep. Join us.

## The Master Plan
We use a variety of software and some in house - some out of the house - some in between. Little by little we hope to make this platform completely indiependent and self sustaining. 

## Ahoy Operations:


## Team Ahoy
- Alex Gonzalez (Founder, Chief FrontEnd Coder, Editor, Graphic Designer)
- Chris Batista (Chief Backend Captain, Live Streaming Specialist, Audio Engineer)
- Rob Meglio (Star, Misc)
- Ellen Jane Martin (DJ, Musical Coordinator, Class Act)
