Ahoy Indie Media
Ahoy Indie Media is a hand-crafted media company based out of New Haven, Connecticut. Our mission is to provide an alternative voice in media, with a focus on independent journalism and storytelling.

At Ahoy Indie Media, we believe that media should be accessible to everyone. That's why we're committed to providing open-source code for all of our projects, so that others can learn from and build upon our work.

Our team is made up of passionate journalists, writers, and creatives who are dedicated to telling stories that matter. We cover a wide range of topics, from politics and social justice to culture and the arts.

Our goal is to provide a platform for underrepresented voices and stories, and to help build a more informed and engaged community. We believe that everyone has a story to tell, and we're here to help tell it.

Thank you for your interest in Ahoy Indie Media. We look forward to sharing our stories with you.
